\chapter{Coq Implementation of LTTT}\label{chap:coq-implementation}

A Coq version of the typing rules and semantics introduced in \ref{chapter:the-type-system} is implemented by the author (\cite{mohammad_ali_a_rabi_2021_4749276}). This chapter is a description of the implementation.
It has multiple parts that we discuss in the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A generic key-value store to be used as the typing context
    \item Implementation of the language types $\T$ and $\A$,
    \item Implementation of terms and expressions, $\t$ and $\e$, respectively,
    \item Declarative typing,
    \item Operational semantics.
\end{itemize}

The main purpose of this chapter is to verify LTTT mechanically.
