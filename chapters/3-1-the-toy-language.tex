\section{Event-Based Toy Language and Types}

Throughout this chapter, a toy language together with a type system is used to discuss using temporal logic in event-driven programming. The type system is presented in the work of \cite{Paykin2016TheEO}. The types are based on the linear/non-linear logic of \cite{DBLP:conf/csl/Benton94} with an addition of $\diamond$ modality.

The language and its type are defined in \figref{fig:syntax-of-types-terms-expressions}. Non-linear types are designated with $\T$ and linear types are designated with $\A$. Terms, denoted by $\t$, form the non-linear fragment of the language. On the other hand, expressions, denoted by $\e$, form the linear fragment.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathtt{Void}$ (resp. $0$) represents a type that is inhabited by no term (resp. expression).
    \item $\mathtt{Unit}$ (resp. $1$) represents a type that is inhabited by exactly one term (resp. expression), namely $()$ (resp. $()$). We won't differentiate the term $()$ and the expression $()$ in notation, as it should be apparent from the context which one we are talking about.
    \item The multiplicative connectives $\times$ and $\otimes$ represent type of pairs, in the non-linear and linear domains, respectively.
    \item The additive connectives $+$ and $\oplus$ are used for branching.
    \item The connectives $\rightarrow$ and $\multimap$ represent the type of functions.
    \item The modality $\diamond$ represent the type of a variable that will eventually become available.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
Two sequent relations are introduced as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The linear sequent $\Gamma; \Delta \vdash \e : \A$ which is defined through \figref{fig:typing-rules-for-linear-types},
    \item The non-linear sequent $\Gamma \vdash \t : \T$ which is defined through \figref{fig:typing-rules-for-nonlinear-types},
    \item The relation between the two sequents are given by \figref{fig:typing-rules-for-linear-and-nonlinear-types}.
\end{itemize}
Here, $\Gamma$ denotes the unrestricted typing context, and $\Delta$ the linear context. The non-linear sequent has access only to the unrestricted context, although the linear sequent has access to both.
