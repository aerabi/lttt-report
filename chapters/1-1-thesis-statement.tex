\section{Thesis Statement}
\textit{Linear-time temporal type theory is a natural model for event-driven programming. The theory is a sound and has practical applications in a variety of programming languages and libraries.}

To support this thesis, this dissertation makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \chapref{chap:background} contains a tutorial and survey of different logics that may be used to form a basis for event-driven programming.
    \item \chapref{chapter:the-type-system} formulates the linear-time temporal type theory, LTTT, based on work of \cite{Paykin2016TheEO}, and discusses its connection to real-world event-driven programming paradigm.
    \item \chapref{chap:coq-implementation} presents the implementation of LTTT in Coq, to verify that the theory's soundness.
    \item \chapref{chap:typescript-implementation} presents an implementation of LTTT in TypeScript, to demonstrate LTTT in practive, and to set an infrastructure for further discussion.
\end{itemize}
