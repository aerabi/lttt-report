\chapter{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my wife and friend, Farnaz, who was there for me in each and every step of way, and helped me out especially with the category theory parts (which didn't end up in the theatrical cut anyway).

I would also thank my adviser Peter Thiemann who beard with me throughout the years. And I would like to thank Andreas Podelski for reading my work: Thanks, man, you're probably the only other person reading it.
