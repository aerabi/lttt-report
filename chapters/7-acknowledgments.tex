\chapter{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my wife and friend, Farnaz, who was there for me every step of the way and helped me out especially with the category theory parts (which didn't end up in the theatrical cut anyway).

I would also thank my adviser Peter Thiemann who beard with me throughout the years. And I would like to thank Andreas Podelski for reading my work: Thanks, man, you're probably the only other person reading it.

Other people I would like to thank are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Leonhard Euler, for inspiring the American Math Society to create such a beautiful font.
    \item Hieronymus Formschneider, for inventing Fraktur.
    \item David Hilbert, for using Fraktur for logical formulae in his \textit{Grundz√ºge der theoretischen Logik}.
    \item Georg Cantor, for no specific reason.
    \item Google Translate, for translating my abstract into German.
\end{itemize}

Also, the following people claimed they have read my work and made helpful comments: Hayk Gevorgyan.
