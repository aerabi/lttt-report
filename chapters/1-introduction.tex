\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}

Event-driven programming is becoming the standard paradigm for programming in almost every domain: backend, frontend, GUI, etc. All of the framework and library vendors are not offering \textit{reactive}, \textit{i.e.} event-driven interfaces for their products. Spring framework came up with WebFlux, Angular is all wrapped in RxJS's observables, and Node.js is async by nature. Reactive drivers are being implemented for databases, to support an end-to-end reactive spectrum.

In such a world, laying a basis for event-driven programming is necessary more than ever. \cite{Paykin2016TheEO} introduced a type system based on linear/non-linear logic of \cite{DBLP:conf/csl/Benton94} and linear-time temporal logic. We will refer to this type system and the theory around it as linear-time temporal type theory, or LTTT for short.

We will explain and examine LTTT from different perspectives. A Coq implementations tries to do a mechanical examination of the theory, and a TypeScript implementation and discussion tries to validate the theory in action.
