\section{Conventions}

Prior familiarity with logic and type systems is helpful but not required. For more background in type systems, we refer the reader to the book of \cite{10.5555/1076265} and especially its first chapter by \cite{DavidWalker2004}.

Throughout the thesis, small Greek letters are used as metavariables in the logics: $\alpha, \beta, \varphi, \psi$. In the type systems, Fraktur letters are used instead: small letters for terms and expressions in the language being typed, e.g. $\t, \e$, and capital letters for the types: $\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B}, \T$. One reason for this separation is because some small Greek letters are used in the toy languages: $\lambda$ for the lambda expression, $\iota$ for injection, and $\pi$ for projection. Furthermore, most capital Greek letters are indistinguishable from their Latin descendants, e.g. $A, B, T$.

In \chapref{chap:coq-implementation}, the Fraktur letters represent types in the metalanguage (in this case Coq).
